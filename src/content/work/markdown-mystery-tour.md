### Cypress

Cypress framework is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework built on Mocha â€“ a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and convenient. Cypress testing library also uses a BDD/TDD assertion library and a browser to pair with any JavaScript testing framework.

### The objective of the project

With our production team, we implemented the Cypress test framework to write test cases at the front-end level to have a good user simulation test and also to test well if all the implemented implementations work perfectly and there are no malfunctions, but most of all it's a better way to ensure a reliable and quality development of the product delivery.

#### advantage

* the quality of the product
* front end well tested
* use of Agile method
